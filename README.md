# DALI Challenge: The API Challenge


[deployed url](https://nervous-davinci-78b495.netlify.app/)

## Description

I used Rawg.io's Api for games to display popular, new and upcoming games.<br>
I used two API's. One for fetching the games and the second one for fetching the game detail data. <br>
I arranged the games in the form of a tile pattern where you can click on indidvual tiles to expand and see more information about the specific game.<br>
